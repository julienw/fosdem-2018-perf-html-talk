# What's the plan?

1. A sampling profiler
2. Call trees
3. The timeline
4. Markers
5. Analyzing a profile

---

# A _sampling_ profiler

* every millisecond we stop Firefox and look at the stack on every thread
* when we capture we gather all these measurements in one profile
* then we _merge_ the stacks into a _call tree_

---

# An example, maybe?

```javascript
function a() {
  b();
}

function b() {
  c();
}

function c() {
  doWork();
}

function doWork() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i += Math.random()) {}
}

a();
```

---

# Taking a sample every 1ms:

```
 1ms      2ms      3ms      4ms      5ms      6ms
-----    -----    -----    -----    -----    -----
  a        a        a        a        a        a
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
  b        b        b        b        b        b
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
  c        c        c        c        c        c
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
doWork   doWork   doWork   doWork   doWork   doWork
```

# A simple call tree

```
  a       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
  b       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
  c       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
doWork    (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 6ms)
```

---
# In the profiler

![A simple call tree](images/a-simple-call-tree.png)

.center[[Build a simple call tree, for real](examples/a-simple-call-tree.html)]

---
# Another example

```javascript
function a() {
  b();
}

function b() {
  c();
}

function c() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i += Math.random()) {
    doNothing();
  }
}

function doNothing() {
}

a();
```

---
# A simpler call tree !

```
  a       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
  b       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
  c       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 6ms)
```

???
We spend too less time in doNothing, so it never shows up when we stop Firefox
to get a sample. We might get one by chance sometimes.
---
# Slightly different

.smaller[
```javascript

function a() {
  b();
}

function b() {
  c();
}

function c() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i += Math.random()) {
    doWork();
  }
}

function doWork() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i += Math.random()) {
  }
}

a();
```
]

---
# Same call tree as the first example

```
  a       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
  b       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
  c       (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 0ms)
  ↓
doWork    (Running time: 6ms) (Self time: 6ms)
```
???
This time we spend enough time in doWork. What's important to see is that even
if we call doWork several times we see it only once in the call tree.

---
# A more complex code

.smallest[
```javascript
function a() { b(); }

function b() {
  c();
  h();
}

function c() {
  d();
  f();
}

function d() { e(); }

function e() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i += Math.random()) {}
}

function f() {
* for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i += Math.random()) {}
  g();
}

function g() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i += Math.random()) {}
}

function h() { f(); }

a();
```

# More samples!

.center[
![Samples for this example](images/branched-samples.png)
]

???
Every ms we get a new stack.
---
# A call tree with branches!
.center[
![A call tree with branches](images/branched-call-tree.png)

[Do it yourself!](examples/a-branched-call-tree.html)
]

???
We merge the functions into a call tree with branches.

---
# In perf.html

.center[
![Screenshot of perf.html for this profile](images/branched-call-tree-in-perf.png)
]

???
See especially the running times: we clearly see we spend time in `f`.

---
# Call tree inversion

.center[
![Screenshot of perf.html after inverting the profile](images/branched-call-tree-in-perf-inverted.png)
]

???
Inverting the call tree makes it easier to see the functions where we spend the
most time.

---
# The timeline

.center[
![Timeline in a profile](images/timeline.png)
]

* This actually shows the stack.
* Changes in the height mean _changes in the stack_.
* This is _not_ the CPU usage.

---
# Markers

* Because we control Gecko's source code, we can _instrument_ it at all the
right places
* Just like developers can _instrument_ their own code with `performance.mark`.

.center[
![React markers](images/markers.png)
]

---
# Markers and call trees

* markers are supplementary to the call tree
* we'll always get all markers
* markers for important events: reflows, garbage collection, DOMEvent
* we generate special markers for when the event loop is stuck

---
# How do _you_ use it?
.smaller[
## Solution 1
1. Go to https://perf-html.io
2. Install the addon
3. Record from the added icon.

## Solution 2
1. Enable the new performance recorder in the Developer Tools' settings
2. Open the _Performance_ panel in the developer tools.
3. Record from the panel.
